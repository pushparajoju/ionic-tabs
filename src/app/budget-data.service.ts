      "opinion": "If the government is looking for a silver bullet in an election year, when the threat of jobless growth is rearing its head, injecting liquidity into the real estate/ construction industry, the biggest generator of jobs the last 25 years, is one of the most viable options. An election year interim budget is normally not something that the industry looks forward to as its agenda tends to be election focused (at the cost of industry). The industry is hoping that this year we are in for a pleasant surprise. The Budget has addressed concerns of farmers and the salaried class by providing relief to small and marginal farmers up to 75 thousand crores and interest subvention up to 5% in the event of natural calamity and; secondly exempting income tax for income up to 5 lakhs. Both these are significantly consumption positive and augur well for overall tax collections in FY 20. While there is a marginal slippage in fiscal deficit target for FY 19, the approach towards consolidation has been diluted for FY20 on account of farmer relief. The net borrowing programme doesn't appear alarmingly high. Overall a good budget that delivered on expectations in an election year."
